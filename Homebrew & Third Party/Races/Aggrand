  <text>Aggrands, for the most part, resemble tall, muscular humans, with one noticeable difference: they have the ability to grow to giant size, as if they had an enlarge spell cast on them. The exact nature of this ability is yet unknown: it appears to be non-magical, as they are able to grow even within an antimagic field or a dead magic zone, but at the same time this ability violates the scientific law of conservation of mass, which states that something cannot be created from nothing without the assistance of magic. Regardless of this ability's nature, it is nonetheless an ability that aggrands possess. While enlarged, aggrands are double the size they were in their smaller form, and their muscles bulge, becoming proportionally larger, compared to their smaller form. Enlarged aggrands have often been mistaken for ogres. Aggrands can remain enlarged only temporarily, but the more that an aggrand uses this ability, the longer they can remain enlarged. The longest period of time that an aggrand has been known to remain enlarged was around 12 minutes. Another notable, but much less noticeable trait is that aggrand women have roughly the same strength and muscle mass as the men of their race, unlike humans, where women tend to have less muscle mass and muscle power than human men.</text>
